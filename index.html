You can replace the placeholder <p>This is the homepage.</p> with something more meaningful that explains the purpose of your site. Here’s a polished bit of text that would fit nicely in your HTML:

<p>
  This website was created to serve as a central hub for all of my GitHub repositories. 
  Each section highlights a different project, explains the ideas behind it, and shares 
  the lessons learned along the way. Whether it's experimenting with homelab setups, 
  automating tasks with Ansible, containerizing applications with Docker, or exploring 
  smart home solutions, the goal is to document the journey and make it easier for others 
  to follow along, learn, and contribute.
</p>
This way, your homepage immediately tells visitors what the site is about and sets the tone for the rest of the content.

Would you like me to also draft a slightly shorter version—something more concise for a clean landing page feel?

“Welcome to My Website” works fine as a title, but it’s a bit generic. Since your site is specifically about describing your GitHub repositories and the ideas behind them, you might want to make the title more descriptive—something like “Exploring My GitHub Projects” or “My GitHub Repository Hub”. That way, visitors immediately know what the site is about.

Here’s the full HTML with a more fitting title and the updated homepage text included:
