      <h2>What is Ansible?</h2>
    <p>
	Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes. It is free to use and benefits from the experience and intelligence of its thousands of contributors.

	Ansible's main strengths are simplicity and ease of use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring minimal moving parts. It uses OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and pull modes as alternatives) and uses a human-readable language designed for getting started quickly without extensive training.

	Key Concepts
	Control Node
	The machine from which you run the Ansible CLI tools.

	Managed Nodes
	Also referred to as 'hosts', these are the target devices (servers, network appliances, or any computer) you aim to manage with Ansible.

	Inventory
	A list of managed nodes provided by one or more 'inventory sources'. Your inventory can specify information specific to each node, like IP address. It is also used for assigning groups, allowing for node selection in the play and bulk variable assignment.

	Playbooks
	Playbooks contain Plays, which are the basic unit of Ansible execution. This is both an 'execution concept' and how we describe the files on which ansible-playbook operates. Playbooks are written in YAML and are easy to read, write, share, and understand. To learn more about playbooks, see Ansible playbooks.

	Plays
	The main context for Ansible execution. A playbook maps managed nodes (hosts) to tasks, containing variables, roles, and an ordered list of tasks. Plays can be run repeatedly, consisting of an implicit loop over the mapped hosts and tasks.

	Roles
	A limited distribution of reusable Ansible content (tasks, handlers, variables, plugins, templates, and files) for use inside of a play.

	Tasks
	The definition of an 'action' to be applied to the managed host. You can execute a single task once with an ad hoc command using ansible or ansible-console, both creating a virtual play.
